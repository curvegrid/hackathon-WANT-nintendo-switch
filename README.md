# hackathon-WANT-nintendo-switch

Welcome to our EthGlobal [Hack.Money](https://hackathon.money/#about) project.

This DApp is an exchange pool for ERC20 tokens.
You earn WANT tokens based on the scarcity of the item you put in.
You can withdraw one token at a time, which is chosen (pseudo)randomly.
Currently it accepts WBTC, DAI, USDC, and ZRX.
Under the hood it uses [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org) and Curvegrid's MultiBaas platform.

# Smart Contracts

The smart contracts are on Rinkeby at [0x42F3e1c5C32819255a18F22bB6eF342f8C73Ba37](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x42f3e1c5c32819255a18f22bb6ef342f8c73ba37) and the ENS domain is [want-nintendo-switch.eth](https://app.ens.domains/name/want-nintendo-switch.eth)

# Middleware
We used [Curvegrid's](https://www.curvegrid.com) blockchain platform MultiBaas to make this project.

# running the code

How to run the frontend:

```
cd web

yarn run serve
```

Connect to the Rinkeby Network. You'll need some USDC, DAI, WBTC, or ZRX to play.

Thanks for trying out our project!
