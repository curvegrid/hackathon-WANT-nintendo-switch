    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <p>
      This DApp is an exchange pool for ERC20 tokens.
      You earn WANT tokens based on the scarcity of the item you put in.
      You can withdraw one token at a time, which is chosen (pseudo)randomly.
      Currently it accepts WBTC, DAI, USDC, and ZRX.
      Under the hood it uses <a
        href="https://uniswap.org/"
        target="_blank"
      >Uniswap</a>.
