    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <p>
      This DApp is an exchange pool for ERC20 tokens.
      You earn WANT tokens based on the scarcity of the item you put in.
      You can withdraw one token at a time, which is chosen (pseudo)randomly.
      Currently it accepts WBTC, DAI, USDC, and ZRX.
      Under the hood it uses <a

      >Uniswap</a> and <a href="https://curvegrid.com">Curvegrid's MultiBaas</a> Platform.
